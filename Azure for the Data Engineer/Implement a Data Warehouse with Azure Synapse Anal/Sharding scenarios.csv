Replicated,✅ Small-dimension tables in a star schema with less than 2GB of storage after compression (~5x compression).,"⛔ Many write transactions are on the table (insert/update/delete).⛔ You change DWU provisioning frequently.⛔ You use only 2-3 columns, but your table has many columns.⛔ You index a replicated table."
Round-robin (default),✅ Temporary/Staging table✅ No obvious joining key or good candidate column.,⛔ Performance is slow due to data movement.
