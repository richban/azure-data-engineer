# Core (SQL)

Description: All of the requirements for your web analytics application can be satisfied by Core (SQL), which makes your decision difficult when choosing between Core (SQL) and Cassandra. Since the web team is already using their Cassandra-based application, and because of their prior experience using the Cassandra Query Language (CQL) for some of their reporting, Cassandra is the right choice for this scenario, although Core (SQL) is still a close second choice.
