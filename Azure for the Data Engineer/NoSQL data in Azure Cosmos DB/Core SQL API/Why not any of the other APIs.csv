API,Description
Azure Table,"This API should only be used to allow existing apps that are based on the Table API access to Azure Cosmos DB. However, new projects should always choose Core (SQL)."
Cassandra,"This API isn't a good choice in this particular scenario, because the schema is unknown and will change over time."
Gremlin,This API isn't a good choice since the scenario doesn't need to process graph-based data.
MongoDB,MongoDB's lack of support for SQL-like queries give Core (SQL) an advantage for your existing relational database users.
